# [Transmission 4.0.0](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/releases/tag/4.0.0)

## Highlights

This is a major release, both in numbering and in effort! It's been in active development for over
a year and has a _huge_ list of changes -- over a thousand commits -- since Transmission 3.00.
Some of the highlights include:

- [**Resource Efficiency**](#resource-efficiency) - Use less memory and fewer CPU cycles
- [**Better Community**](#community) - Pull requests welcomed and used
- [**Code Modernization**](#code-modernization) - Migrated from C90 to modern C++
- [**New Features**](#new-features) - What would a major release be without them?

### Resource Efficiency

- The code has been extensively profiled and improved to fix inefficient code and memory use. For example, a stress test of starting transmission-daemon with 25,000 torrents is almost entirely IO-bound, using 50% fewer CPU cycles and 70% fewer memory allocations than Transmission 3.00.

- The remote control GUIs (transmission-qt and transmission-web) now use the RPC API "table" mode, resulting in smaller payloads / less bandwidth use.
- RPC payloads are now compressed using [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate), a "heavily optimized [library that is] significantly faster than the zlib library."

### Community

- The project is much more responsive to bug reports and code submissions than it has been in the past.
- There is a new group of volunteer contributors who are working on Transmission!
- Transmission 4.0.0 includes over 350 new community commits (see [the Thank You section below](#thank-you) and in the previous 4.0.0 betas) since 3.00 and welcomes new contributors.
- Documentation has been moved into the `transmission/transmission` so that contributors can submit PRs to improve it.

### Code Modernization

- The entire codebase has been migrated from C to C++. In the process, we've removed thousands of lines of custom code and used standard C++ tools instead. The core's code has shrunk by 18%. The core codebase has been extensively refactored to be more testable and maintainable.
- The GTK client has been ported to [gtkmm](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/).
- The Web client has been rewritten in modern JavaScript and no longer uses jQuery. The entire gzipped bundle is now 68K.
- The unit tests have been expanded and ported to [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). Clang sanitizer builds are run during CI.
- The core library is now fuzz tested.
- Transmission now uses Sonarcloud, Coverity, LGTM, and clang-tidy static analysis on new code. Several hundred code warnings have been fixed compared to Transmission 3.00.

### New Features

- Support for using [BitTorrent v2](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html) torrents and [hybrid](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html#upgrade-path) torrents. (Support for _creating_ v2 and hybrid torrents is slated for an upcoming release.)
- Users can now set "default" trackers that can be used to announce all public torrents.
- Newly-added seeds can start immediately and verify pieces on demand, instead of needing a full verify before seeding can begin. ([#2626](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/2626))
- Added an option to omit potentially-identifying information (e.g. User-Agent and date created) when creating new torrents. ([#3452](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/3452))
- The Web client has been rewritten and now supports mobile use.
- When creating new torrents, users can now specify the piece size. ([#3768](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/3768), [#3145](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/3145), [#2805](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/2805))
- IPv6 blocklists are now supported. ([#3835](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/3835))
- Beginning with 4.0.0-beta.1, Transmission releases now use [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning.
- Dozens of other new features -- too many to list here! We've been working on this for a year!
