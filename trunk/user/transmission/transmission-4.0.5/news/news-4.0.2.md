## What's New in 4.0.2

### Highlights

* Fixed `4.0.1` bug where some torrents thought they were magnet links. ([#5025](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/5025))
* Fixed `4.0.0` bug that broke watchdirs in the macOS client. ([#5058](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/5058), macOS Client)
* Fixed `4.0.0` bug where download speed limits were ignored for uTP peers. ([#5086](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/5086))
* Fixed `4.0.0` bug using `announce-list` when creating single-tracker private torrents. ([#5106](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/5106))

### All Platforms

* Restored support for `path.utf-8` keys in torrent info dictionaries. ([#3454](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/3454))
* Fixed value of `TR_TIME_LOCALTIME` environment variable in torrent scripts. ([#5006](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/5006))
