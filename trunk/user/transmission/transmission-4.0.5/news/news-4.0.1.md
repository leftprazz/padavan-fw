# Transmission 4.0.1

The `4.0.0` release two weeks ago generated a lot of [useful feedback](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/issues) (thank you!!) so we've been busy fixing bugs. This release has only bug fixes, documentation improvements, and build script fixes to make packaging easier.

RIP, Yeeshkul. TJ, your tracker is one of the first things that got me (@ckerr) interested in torrents when I started contributing to the Transmission project back in 2007. So long and thanks for all the fish.
