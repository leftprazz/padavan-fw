    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure Transmission's <a href="portforward.html">port is forwarded</a>. Port forwarding makes it easier for others to connect to you, which therefore increases your speed.
            <div class="taskbox">
                <p>If your router supports NAT-PMP, UPnP, or you have Apple AirPort, Transmission can do this automatically; just tick the checkbox in Preferences &rarr; Network.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>Make sure you cap your upload speed, so that it isn't flooded. A good rule of thumb is about 60-70% of your maximum upload bandwidth. This can be adjusted in Preferences &rarr; Bandwidth, or in real time using the Action menu.
            <div class="taskbox">
                <p>eg. If your upload connection is 256 Kilobits/sec, then you should cap it at 21 KB/sec ((<strong>256</strong> / 8) * 0.66 = <strong>21</strong>).
            </div>
        </li>

        <li><a href="gettingstarted.html#queue">Queue</a> your transfers. Transmission's queue preferences are located in Transfers &rarr; Management.
            <p>Remember, your download speed is proportional to how fast you upload. If there are many transfers running, then each transfer will only receive a small proportion of your upload bandwidth, reducing their respective download speeds.
                To avoid spreading your upload too thinly, a good rule of thumb is to have at least 128 KBit/sec of upload bandwidth for every torrent you wish to run simultaneously.

            <div class="taskbox">
                <p>eg. If your upload bandwidth is 256 KBit/sec, then you should only have two (<strong>256</strong>/128 = <strong>2</strong>) downloading transfers in the queue.
