wslay 1.1.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds CMake build support and the ability to set and
verify reserved bits.  Build issue with nettle >= 3.4 was fixed.

Changes
-------

* Fix compilation of examples

  Since 3.4 nettle defines base64_encode_raw like this:

      void base64_encode_raw(char *dst, size_t length, const uint8_t *src);

  So examples have to be adjusted. More read at

  Patch from Sergey Avseyev

* check for 0 length before memcpy:

  .../wslay/lib/wslay_event.c:304:7: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null

  Patch from Anders Bakken

* Skip UTF-8 validation for PMCE fragments

  If the message was marked with rsv1 on the initial frame then we
  should skip utf-8 validation on subsequent continuation frames as
  well.

  Added test for this case.

  Found by autobahn wstest tool.

  Patch from Isaac Boukris

* Allow RSV1 bit in event-based API for PMCE - RFC 7692

  Add a new function wslay_event_set_allowed_rsv_bits which only accpet
  RSV1 for now (or 0 to disable).

  Skip UTF-8 validation on frames with RSV1 set as it is too early for that.

  Add extended versions of wslay_event_queue_msg functions which also
  take the reserved bits to set for this message.
