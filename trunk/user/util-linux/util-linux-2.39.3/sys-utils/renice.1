.SH "NAME"
renice \- alter priority of running processes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrenice\fP [\fB\-\-priority|\-\-relative\fP] \fIpriority\fP [\fB\-g\fP|\fB\-p\fP|\fB\-u\fP] \fIidentifier\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrenice\fP alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The first argument is the \fIpriority\fP value to be used. The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default), process group IDs, user IDs, or user names. \fBrenice\fP\*(Aqing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered. \fBrenice\fP\*(Aqing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.
.sp
If no \fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-priority\fP or \fB\-\-relative\fP option is used, then the priority is set as \fBabsolute\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-n\fP \fIpriority\fP
.RS 4
Specify the \fBabsolute\fP or \fBrelative\fP (depending on environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT) scheduling \fIpriority\fP to be used for the process, process group, or user. Use of the option \fB\-n\fP is optional, but when used, it must be the first argument. See \fBNOTES\fP for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-priority\fP \fIpriority\fP
.RS 4
Specify an \fBabsolute\fP scheduling \fIpriority\fP. \fIPriority\fP is set to the given value. This is the default, when no option is specified.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-relative\fP \fIpriority\fP
.RS 4
Specify a \fBrelative\fP scheduling \fIpriority\fP. Same as the standard POSIX \fB\-n\fP option. \fIPriority\fP gets \fIincremented/decremented\fP by the given value.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-pgrp\fP
.RS 4
Interpret the succeeding arguments as process group IDs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pid\fP
.RS 4
Interpret the succeeding arguments as process IDs (the default).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-user\fP
.RS 4
Interpret the succeeding arguments as usernames or UIDs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
\fI/etc/passwd\fP
.RS 4
to map user names to user IDs
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
Users other than the superuser may only alter the priority of processes they own. Furthermore, an unprivileged user can only \fIincrease\fP the "nice value" (i.e., choose a lower priority) and such changes are irreversible unless (since Linux 2.6.12) the user has a suitable "nice" resource limit (see \fBulimit\fP(1p) and \fBgetrlimit\fP(2)).
.sp
The superuser may alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in the range \-20 to 19. Useful priorities are: 19 (the affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the "base" scheduling priority), anything negative (to make things go very fast).
.sp
For historical reasons in this implementation, the \fB\-n\fP option did not follow the POSIX specification. Therefore, instead of setting a \fBrelative\fP priority, it sets an \fBabsolute\fP priority by default. As this may not be desirable, this behavior can be controlled by setting the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT to be fully POSIX compliant. See the \fB\-n\fP option for details. See \fB\-\-relative\fP and \fB\-\-priority\fP for options that do not change behavior depending on environment variables.
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
The \fBrenice\fP command appeared in 4.0BSD.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The following command would change the priority of the processes with PIDs 987 and 32, plus all processes owned by the users daemon and root:
.sp
\fBrenice +1 987 \-u daemon root \-p 32\fP
